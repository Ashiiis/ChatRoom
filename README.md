# ChatRoom
this project consist of a chat room on the landing page from wher user can join a chatroom they need to login with their name and password , after succesfull login users can chat with each other in the common chat room 
HOW TO USE THIS .
at first we need to download any dependency if required then your terminal's directory should be C:\user\yourFolder\ChatApp 
you need to input the command "py manage.py runserver"  to run the local server if any error persists then try "py manage.py makemigrations" and then "py manage.py migrate" commands 
then again type "py manage.py runserver" to run server 
to setup your login creditionals you need to type "py manage.py createsuperuser"
then provide the details asked by the terminal and after succesfully creation of super user you can use your name and password for login 
to test the functionality you can duplicate the server in the browser and login to the duplicate page with different login id 
now your both id's are in the same chatroom you can send and recieve messages from each other 
you can also check the number of users are online by clicking on the " see online users" 
the refresh time of active users is initially set to 10 sec, which can be changed easily.
